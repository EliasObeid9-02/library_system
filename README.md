# Library System API

Library Website API built using Django, Django Rest Framework, Rest Knox Authentication and Django Filters.

The API methods are used by frontend code to allow users and librarians to access the books available in the
library. Librarians have access for adding new books, authors, categories, publications and book copies. While normal users can access the available books in the library, search and filter through them and borrow copies of books.
